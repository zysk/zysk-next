                    ZyskaThon isn‚Äôt just about coding; it‚Äôs about learning,
                    growing, and understanding the magic that happens when
                    brilliant minds come together. As a team predominantly in
                    the early stages of our tech careers, this event will be a
                    platform to challenge ourselves, to see the power of
                    collaboration, and most importantly, to enjoy the journey of

                      <h3>Key Points to Remember:</h3>

                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          Look beyond the flashiness ‚Äî a simple project with
                          depth and a clear impact can be more valuable than a
                          complex but shallow one.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Remember the teams experience. Many of our
                          participants have 1-3 years of experience, so its
                          essential to assess effort, learning, and growth, not
                          just the result.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                          Keep the companys mission in mind: Beyond technical
                          prowess, think about how projects can help in creating
                          more job opportunities and make a societal difference.

                        Providing feedback, both positive and areas for
                        improvement, is crucial. Each team can grow and learn
                        from your insights.

                        runner-up. Remember, we have prizes worth INR 40,000 for

                        choices for these accolades.
